# Color Palette
This app is a color palette generator using React. It is a fairly simple concept, but it has been a great learning experience. 
The application can be accessed here: 
## How it works
The application shows tiles in randomly selected colors, and it allows the user to change the colors using the space bar. Once the user likes a color, they can click on the lock icon on the tile to lock in that color. They can continue changing up the rest of the palette to their liking.
## Future Functionality
In the future, I intend to get all of the buttons functioning. I am missing functionality from the generate button, drag and drop, tutorial, and add buttons.
The drag and drop seems like it may be the most difficult piece to accomplish. 
Once I have everything functioning, I will get the tutorial button to display a tutorial.
