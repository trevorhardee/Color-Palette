# Color-Palette
This app was used a project to build on my React skills. It is a color palette generator. The app randomly generates colors and allows the user to lock the colors that they like. To switch between colors the user presses the spacebar.
This is only the first implementation. In the future, I plan to add buttons that will switch the colors, add more colors, drag the colors to different spots, and remove colors. Some of the colors are dark, which makes it difficult to see the text, so adding some functionality to change the text color depending on the tile color may be coming soon.

The app can be seen here: https://trevorhardee.github.io/Color-Palette/

This project was inspired by coolors.co.
