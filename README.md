# Color-Palette

This is an application to create a color palette with randomly generated colors. 

# How it works
The user can change the color of all of the unlocked palettes by clicking the generate button or pressing the space bar. An individual palette can be changed by clicking on the top icon when hovering on the palette. The hex color code can be copied by clicking on the second icon when hovering on the palette. The palette can be locked from changing when the third icon is clicked. The user should see a locked icon on the palettes that have been locoked.

# About
This project was inspired by a color palette website that is much more in depth than what I produced. It provides me with the same basic functionality without the advertisements.
This was a good use case on using Redux, so I refactored the application that I worked on around 6 months prior to use Redux. In the future, I may provide functionality to the tutorial button, make an option to add palettes to the app, and allow the user to switch the positions of the palettes.
